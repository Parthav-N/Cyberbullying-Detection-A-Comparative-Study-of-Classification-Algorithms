## Overview

Welcome to the Cyberbullying Detection project! This repository contains code and resources for a comprehensive study of classification algorithms used in the context of cyberbullying detection. We explore various machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify cyberbullying in text data.

## Dataset

The `cyberbullying_tweets.csv` dataset used in this study on cyberbullying detection is sourced from Kaggle and comprises a total of 47,692 tweets. The dataset consists of two primary columns:

- **Tweet Text:** Contains the actual text of the tweet.
- **Cyberbullying Type:** Indicates the type of cyberbullying present in the tweet.

## Code Notebooks
